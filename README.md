# Network Science 2013/24 - Project - #BlackLivesMatter

This repository contains data pre-processing steps of a data set composed of posts on Twitter published in 2013 and 2020 with hashtags related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The file [**DataPreProcessing_selection**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/BLM-NS2023-24/blob/main/DataPrep/DataPreProcessing_selection.py) can be used to cut the data set to the selected time frame and in code [**DataPreProcessing_filtering**](https://github.com/TheresaMeier/BLM-NS2023-24/blob/main/DataPrep/DataPreProcessing_filtering.py), a PCA is run on the data set for 2020 to reduce the number of posts and select the most important ones in terms of metrics like reply and like count.

All other steps including the data polishing, topic detection and semantic analyses are on [**Google Colab**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BEwIKiNm_8_VAIShAYXkXnJNZoNxkCi7?usp=sharing).
